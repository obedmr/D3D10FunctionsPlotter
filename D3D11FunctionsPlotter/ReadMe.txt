    WIN32 APPLICATION : D3D11SimpleTeapot Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this D3D11SimpleTeapot application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your D3D11SimpleTeapot application.


D3D11SimpleTeapot.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

D3D11SimpleTeapot.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

D3D11SimpleTeapot.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

D3D11SimpleTeapot.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file D3D11SimpleTeapot.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file D3D11SimpleTeapot.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named D3D11SimpleTeapot.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
